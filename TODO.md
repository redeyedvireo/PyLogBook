# PyLogBook To Do

- Implement saving of window size and position in the prefs file.
- Implement font family and size buttons in the editor
- Implement Search
- Implement Addendum button
- Implement Import/Export XML
- Make the log tree able to grow vertically
- Search for all TODO items and fix
- Get the C++ version to run, and verify that all needed functionality is present
- Use Python sqlite3 module instead of Qt's SQL support (do this much later)
