# PyLogBook To Do

These are roughly in order of priority.

- Implement Import/Export XML
- Implement font family and size buttons in the editor
  - Figure out why font cannot be set in the document.
- Implement Search
- Implement Addendum button
- Add Linux support for directory for saving prefs (~/.pylogbook/pylogbook.ini)
- Make the log tree able to grow vertically
- Search for all TODO items and fix
- Get the C++ version to run, and verify that all needed functionality is present
- Create PyInstaller for both Windows and Linux
- Use Python sqlite3 module instead of Qt's SQL support (do this much later)
- Use PySide instead of PyQt (much later)
