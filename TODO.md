# PyLogBook To Do

These are roughly in order of priority.

- Implement Style button
- Use PySide instead of PyQt (much later)
  - Create a new git branch for this.
- Figure out why font cannot be set in the document.
- Implement Search, but do this as a modeless dialog, rather than as a pane in the app window.
- I think there is a bug at startup where if a log file can't be opened, the program crashes
- Search for all TODO items and fix
- Compare with the C++ version that all needed functionality is present
- Create PyInstaller for both Windows and Linux
- Use Python sqlite3 module instead of Qt's SQL support (do this much later)
